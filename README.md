# benstress
For stressing your computer, or yourself if you're supposed to be studing for finals but are instead programming it

To run the Java version:
run as
  java -jar benstress-java/benstress.jar -h
  
To run C++ version:
1. Go into benstress
1. You can try to run
    benstress -h
  but it probably won't work and you'll have to compile it yourself. Good luck!
